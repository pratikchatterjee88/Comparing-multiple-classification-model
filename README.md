# Comparing-multiple-classification-model

I have tried to create a multiple model comparision with respect to accuracy score for a synthetic dataset created.
It is a classification model.

Hyperparameters have not been used into this yet, just the default state of each models have been used.

Some of the algorithms used are:
# - Random Forest Classifier
# - AdaBoosting
# - SVM with multiple kernals
# - NeuralNet
# - Decision Tree
to name a few.
